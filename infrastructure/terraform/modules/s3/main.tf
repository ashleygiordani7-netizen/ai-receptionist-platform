# General-purpose object storage bucket (recordings, transcripts, KB source
# docs — per the TDD's tooling table). Provisioned now as infrastructure;
# nothing writes to it until the milestones that actually need it (M5+).
# Private, encrypted at rest, versioned — matches the project's security
# principles ("encrypt sensitive data") even though it's empty today.
